# sNCL
sNCL (simple NCL) is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to ease the creation of
interactive multimedia applications based on [NCL (Nested Context Language)](http://www.ncl.org.br).  
After creating a program using sNCL, you can compile it to NCL and run it using the [Ginga](http://www.ginga.org.br) middleware.

Please, go to the [language documentation](https://sncl.readthedocs.io/) page to find out details about the 
language, and the [installation](https://sncl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-sncl) and [program execution](https://sncl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#running-an-sncl-program)
procedures. Here, just to give you a taste of the language, the following 
source code shows a simple example that plays two videos in sequence:

```
port media video1
  src: "video2.mp4"
  bounds: "0,0,100%,100%"
end
media video2
  src: "video2.mp4"
  bounds: "25%,25%,50%,50%"
end

onEnd video1 do
  start video2 end
end
```
