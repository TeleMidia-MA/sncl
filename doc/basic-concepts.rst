Basic Concepts of sNCL
======================

sNCL (simpler Nested Context Language) follows the NCM model, which is a conceptual model for
the representation and handling of hypermedia documents. The model separates its elements in
**representation elements**, that defines the representation of a media object in time and 
space and **relationship elements**, that defines the relationship between the media objects.

Thus, the elements in sNCL are divided in Representation elements and Relationship Elements.

Representation Elements are:
   1. Context
   2. Media
   3. Area
   4. Switch

Relationship Elements are:
   1. Link

sNCL supports **macros**.

As the name suggests, the language is composed of nested context. The whole body of the
document itself is seen as a context, the main context, in which the application starts, that
can have other contexts inside it.
